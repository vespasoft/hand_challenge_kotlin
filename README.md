**Introduction**
You find a strange mirror that always shows a hand that is moving. The hand appears to be alive, and after a lot of questions of "yes" and "no" answer, you know that the hand is trying to teach you a program that is written in HPL (Hand Programming Language).
This language works with a memory of an indefinite size of bytes, with all values initialized to 0. This language haves 7 instructions:
👉 : moves the memory pointer to the next cell
👈 : moves the memory pointer to the previous cell
👆 : increment the memory cell at the current position
👇 : decreases the memory cell at the current position.
🤜 : if the memory cell at the current position is 0, jump just after the corresponding 🤛
🤛 : if the memory cell at the current position is not 0, jump just after the corresponding 🤜
👊 : Display the current character represented by the ASCII code defined by the current position.

Notes:
* As memory cells are bytes, from 0 to 255 value, if you decrease 0 you'll get 255, if you increment 255 you'll get 0.
* Loops of 🤜 and 🤛 can be nested.

Tests
The hand shows you two small programs and their outputs:

This program display "Hello"
